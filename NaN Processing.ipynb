    "### NaN removal explained\n",
    "I have not set out to create an exhaustive process for removing all NaNs from any data set using these features. Rather I have looked to tackle the NaNs missing from these specific training and test sets but generalised where possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Starting Point\n",
    "18 features in the training set contain NaNs, 33 features in the test set contain NaNs.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Lot Frontage\n",
    "\n",
    "All dwellings are houses so should have some frontage, i.e. there are no flats which would not have any street connected to the property. I will impute this with the mean frontage for the Neighbourhood of the house.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Alley \n",
    "\n",
    "Na for this feature is defined in data description as meaning there is no alley access -> change to \"None\".\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Mason Venner Type and Area\n",
    "\n",
    "MasVrnType and MasVrnArea have multiple instances where the Area is 0 in which case the Type NaN should be set to 'None'. There is one instance in the test set where an Area is given but no type. This is for record 1150. Inspecting this record the house is made of plywood and the most common Veneer type for Plywood houses when they have one is \"BrkFace\".\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Basement Variables\n",
    "Test observation 660 has a NaN for TotalBsmtSF. Examining this record it does not appear that there is a basement. I have therefore set TotalBsmtSF to 0 which will allow the other basement feature processing to occur without error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where there is a total basement area greater than 0 but missing basement quality and/ or condition entries these have been assumes as 'TA', which is the coding for typical quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where the total basement area is zero and qualitative qualitative basement feature values are missing these have been set to 'None', except for 'BasementExposure' which has been set to 'No' to fit with the convention for this feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a basement has a valid FinType1 and a NaN for FinType to this has been set to 'Unf'.\n",
    "\n",
    "If total basement SF = 0 and BsmtFinSF1 is NaN then BsmtFinSF1 and BsmtUnfSF have been set to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Missing BsmtFinSF2 has been set to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Electrical\n",
    "The house missing this info (training id 1379) has air con which implies it must have electrical. I will impute this as the modal electrical type.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### FireplaceQu\n",
    "All NaNs for this feature correspond to the 'Fireplace' feature being 0 so are set to 'None'.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Garage Variables\n",
    "Test observation 1116 appears to have a garage but is missing almost all information about it other than it is detached. I have dealt with this as a special case rather than in the main function. To impute the missing values I have grouped houses by their zone and garage type and worked out the modal value for other garage features and input these into test observation 1116.\n",
    "\n",
    "Test observation 1132 has a 'GarageYrBlt' value of 2207. Looking at this record it seems that this should have been 2007 so this has been explicitely corrected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other qualitative garage feature NaNs correspond to houses without garages so have been set to 'Non\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Pool Quality\n",
    "There are some Pools which have an area but no quality value. These have been set to Gd as this is the most common quality in the training set (albeit with a small sample size). All other NaNs are 'None'.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Fence\n",
    "NaNs are assumed as not having a fence so set to 'None'.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Misc Feature\n",
    "NaNs set to 'None'.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### MSZoning\n",
    "MSZoning - all hosues must be zoned, impute as modal zone type.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Utilities\n",
    "All houses should have some utility access so this has been imputed as the modal value for the feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Exterior Covering\n",
    "I have assumed that houses in the same neighbourhood have similar styles and that all houses have some exterior covering. NaNs have been imputed as the modal type for their neighbourhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Kitchen Quality\n",
    "Where a kitchen is present but has a NaN for quality these has been set to typical 'TA'.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Functionality\n",
    "NaNs for this feature have been set to 'Typ' as this fits with the most common entry and likelihood based on feature description.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Sale Type\n",
    "NaNs set to 'WD' as the most likely value."
